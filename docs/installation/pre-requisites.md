## System requirements

Container Desktop requires WLS2 which is supported on these Windows versions:

## Stop or Uninstall Docker Desktop.

Container Desktop is an alternative to the Docker Desktop. Container desktop is using the same named-pipe Interface for the clients to connect to (the docker-cli and docker-compose cli).

If you currently have docker-desktop installed, you either need to **quit** *"Docker Desktop"* if you want to try-out ***"Container Desktop"*** or  **uninstall/remove** *"Docker Desktop"* if you are convinced that ***"Container Desktop"*** is a proper replacement.
